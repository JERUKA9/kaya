<p>Kaya is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> using the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum/">QtRuby</a> bindings for Qt. Therefore, you need the ruby interpreter and said bindings to run it.</p>

<p>Kaya can be run in KDE or Qt mode via the <code>kaya</code> and <code>kaya-qt</code> executables, respectively. When running in Qt mode, there is no dependency on KDE; KDE-specific features are of course disabled, but almost all the functionality is still there. The <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum/">korundum</a> binding is required to run Kaya in KDE mode.</p>

<p>Kaya may also be run without installing (using the <code>kaya</code> or <code>kaya-qt</code> scripts in the root directory), with some caveats:
<ul>
<li>If you want the extension to be found, put the compiled library in the <code>lib/ext</code> directory.</li>
<li>KDE forces some files to be installed, namely the icons and <code>kaya.notifyrc</code>. You might want to copy (or symlink) those files to the appropriate directories, or the corresponding features will be disabled or possibly misbehaving.</li>
</ul>
If you are hacking the code, or developing a plugin, running kaya in place is of course much more convenient than installing every time you make a change.</p>
