<h3>Latest Release (0.1)</h3>

<p class='download'><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="images/download.png" /><a href="tarballs/kaya-0.1.tar.gz">Download source tarball</a></p>

<p>Kaya is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> using the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum/">Korundum</a> bindings for KDE. Therefore, you need the ruby interpreter and said bindings to run it.</p>

<p>Kaya also includes some parts written in C++. To compile them, you need a KDE 4 development environment, and the ruby headers. On Ubuntu and similar systems, it should be enough to install <em>kde-devel</em> and <em>ruby1.8-dev</em>. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the <code>INSTALL</code> file.</p>

<p>Note that the C++ extension is optional, but some graphical effects are disabled when it is not installed.</p>

<p>Kaya may also be run without installing (using the <code>kaya</code> script in the root directory), with some caveats:
<ul>
<li>If you want the extension to be found, put the compiled library in the <code>lib/ext</code> directory.</li>
<li>KDE forces some files to be installed, namely the icons, the <em>XMLGUI</em> configuration file (<code>kayaui.rc</code>), and <code>kaya.notifyrc</code>. You might want to copy (or symlink) those files to the appropriate directories, or the corresponding features will be disabled or possibly misbehaving.</li>
</ul>
If you are hacking the code, or developing a plugin, running kaya in place is of course much more convenient than installing every time you make a change.</p>
